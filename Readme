How i'm going to implement the text editor:
    1. Setup - WSL.
    2. Entering raw mode.
    3. Raw input and output.
    4. A text viewer.
    5. A text editor.
    6. Search.
    7. Syntax highlighting.
    8. Appendices.


[1. Setup]:
Just going to install the requierment needed for starting the project, and that's :
    a virtual machine, 
    a compiler,
    make.

[2. Entering the raw mode]:
The terminal function in 2 modes, one of wich it's call a raw mode.
It is useful because in a text editor we want to read a character imediatly that we receive it! No need to press the ENTER key on the keyboard.

[3. Raw input and output]:
Here we draw a tidle at the beginning of each line.
We let the user controlling the cursor.
We also print a welcome message in the middle of the screen along with the version of our application.

[4. A text viewer]:
/*
    TODO
    ____
*/
